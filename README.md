TimeStampNow uses Cloudflare Workers to publish the current UNIX timestamp in a simple form that anyone can use over HTTP or HTTPS.

TimeStampNow is a free service anyone can use for any purpose. It is used by millions of people to provide reliable server time when apps or games makers want to have time related features based on non-local time but do not want to run their own server just for a timestamp.

The code powering TimeStampNow is simple and published here as open source under CC0.
